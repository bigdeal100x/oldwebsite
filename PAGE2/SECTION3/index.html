      <h1>W . R L D</h1>
      <P>Internet art or Net art refers to a movement that was prominent in the 1990s and early 2000s where you create art that is made on and for the internet. While net art explores and experiments with the possibilities and limitations of the web, post-Internet art dives deeper by investigating the intersections of the online and offline world. One of the biggest contributions to the offline and online world interlacing is information and communication. The information we send and receive through computer devices creates ambiguity as text (and even images) can lack tone and emotional context, this is because the way we communicate in the internet world is absurd and modifiable. We can no longer be certain that what we see on the internet is true and yet we rely on the internet for facts, knowledge, and guidance. Our relationship with the Internet and the Internet itself is absurd: irrational, constantly searching for truth but never finding it due to the vagueness and shallowness that is the flat screen. This philosophy inspired me to create an art-centric website that discusses the themes of the internet, information, and absurdity. Providing users with an opportunity to be conscious inside the digital realm instead of being persuaded, hypnotized, or sold.</P>
   <P>The first page explores text, information, accessibility, and uncertainty. The Internet is a great platform to access news and share opinions. But how much of our opinions actually make sense? How much of our news is true? Our politics have been bathed in skepticism, leaving us with a sense that we’re being scammed and defrauded and lied to but that a “real truth” still lurks somewhere. Why do we work so hard to find something that isn’t there? The first page includes two sections: a page where text meshes together, making it impossible to read, and a separate page where you have to move the text through the holes in order to read, forcing you to work to read.</P>
   <P>The second page analyzes social media while paying homage to early 2000s net art and web design. The first section has a fixed-positioned AI-generated image on the interior of a car while the windows are transparent, allowing you to scroll through various AI-generated backgrounds so you can make the scene your own. This was a critique of how simple it is to create your own reality and post it on the internet as if it were real. Artificial intelligence image processing has been increasingly more accessible and popular over the years, allowing you to replace one face in a video with another. You can place yourself anywhere with anyone. Even before AI-generated art and images became popularized, social media has been notorious for deceiving skits and attention-seeking content. The second section actualizes the user inside the Internet world by having your webcam record you being behind various social media platforms, online stores, and news sites. The web has the tendency to take the user out of physical reality and immersed inside the Internet realm without actually being entirely conscious, it’s hypnotic. This section will give you the ability to see yourself inside the Internet and situate yourself inside websites you typically get abstracted and entranced in. Lastly, the third section is a tribute to early 2000s net art and web design. Web design did not exist as a thing. Developers made the websites by themselves using only HTML code and it was up to them how these sites would look. There were no menus, search bars, filters, or sorting tools. Manual scrolling was the only option. Due to the limitations of the computer in the early 2000s, web developers were determined to bring personality into their sites in order to keep the users engaged.</P>
   <P>The final page of this art-centric website is meant to relax you. The page will showcase three different 360-degree images (preferably video, if possible) that you will be able to navigate inside with meditative ambient music playing in the background. It’ll take 10 seconds to dissolve from one moving image to the other. This transition effect encourages you to think of one’s own temporality as well as consider the physics of the computer: how it transforms its display and content. This page puts us in the present and accentuates our relationship with not only the web but the computer as well.</P>
   <P>In conclusion, the Internet must be classified as a universe. It possesses an absurdity, order, and freedom that is synonymous with the way Earth and physical reality function. W.rld, unlike net art (which uses the internet as an artistic medium/canvas), deconstructs the Web to help us reflect on our relationship with the Internet and how it affects our own existentialism perception.</P>
